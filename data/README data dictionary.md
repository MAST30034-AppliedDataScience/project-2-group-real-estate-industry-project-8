# Data Dictionary

The process for downloading and forming the dataset can be found in the main README.

The following dictionary is for the dataset used in our modelling and analysis. There was other data collected which was not utilised in this final dataset as it was deemed to be irrelevant or of poor quality such as internet speed test data or current domain.com.au data. The dataset separates each row by suburb and year. Years extending past 2024 uses values predicted using ARIMA.
